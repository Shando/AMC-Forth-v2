# DUCKRUNQUERY &emsp; (DuckRunQuery)
Runs an SQL query against the currently opened database.<br/> The 'qry' must be created using S".<br/> Here are some example queries (see https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/sql/introduction):<br/>     CREATE TABLE weather (city VARCHAR, temp_lo INTEGER, temp_hi INTEGER, prcp FLOAT, date DATE);<br/>     DROP TABLE tablename;<br/>     INSERT INTO weather (city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date) VALUES ('San Francisco', 43, 57, 0.0, '1994-11-29');<br/>     SELECT * FROM weather;<br/>     SELECT city, temp_lo, temp_hi, prcp, date FROM weather;<br/>     SELECT * FROM weather WHERE city = 'San Francisco' AND prcp > 0.0;<br/>     SELECT * FROM weather ORDER BY city, temp_lo;<br/>     SELECT DISTINCT city FROM weather ORDER BY city;<br/>     SELECT weather.city, weather.temp_lo, weather.temp_hi, weather.prcp, weather.date, cities.lon, cities.lat         FROM weather, cities WHERE cities.name = weather.city;     SELECT * FROM weather INNER JOIN cities ON weather.city = cities.name;<br/>     SELECT * FROM weather LEFT OUTER JOIN cities ON weather.city = cities.name;<br/>     UPDATE weather SET temp_hi = temp_hi - 2, temp_lo = temp_lo - 2 WHERE date > '1994-11-28';<br/>     DELETE FROM weather WHERE city = 'Hayward';<br/>NOTE: DuckDB supports the standard SQL data types INTEGER, SMALLINT, FLOAT, DOUBLE, DECIMAL, CHAR(n), VARCHAR(n), DATE, TIME and TIMESTAMP.<br/>NOTE1: DuckDB also supports some non-standard data types, such as: BOOLEAN, TINYINT, UINTEGER, USMALLINT and UTINYINT. It also supports other types, but these will not work with this implementation.<br/>NOTE2: Puts 'TRUE' or 'FALSE' on the stack depending on the success of the operation.<br/>NOTE3: For Data Definition Language commands, such as CREATE, DROP, ALTER & TRUNCATE, 'u' will always be 0.<br/>NOTE4: For Data Query Language commands, such as SELECT, 'u' will be the total number of results. These can be retrieved using 'u' and GETROWDATA or GETROWDATA$.<br/>NOTE5: For Data Manipulation Language commands, such as INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE, 'u' will be the number of affected rows.<br/>NOTE6: For Data Control Language and Transaction Control Language commands, such as GRANT, REVOKE, COMMIT, ROLLBACK etc., 'u' will always be 0.<br/>Example usage: myQry DUCKRUNQUERY
* ( qry -- u flag )
