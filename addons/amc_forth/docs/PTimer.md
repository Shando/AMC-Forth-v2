# P-TIMER &emsp; (PTimer)
Start a periodic timer with id i, and interval n (msec) that calls execution token given by <name>. Does nothing if the id is in use. Example usage: <id> <msec> P-TIMER <name>. NOTE: Timeouts less than 50 msec will suffer from long-term timing drift. Each timeout 50 msec or greater may be slightly inaccurate, but will average to the correct period with no long-term drift. P-TIMER should not be used inside a colon definition, unless <name> is provided following the invocation of the definition.
