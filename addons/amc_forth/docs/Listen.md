# LISTEN &emsp; (Listen)
Add a lookup entry for the IO port p, to execute 'word'. Events to port p are enqueued with q mode (0, 1, 2), where q = enqueue: 0 - always, 1 - if new value, 2 - replace all prior. LISTEN should not be used inside a colon definition, unless <name> is provided following invocation of the definition. NOTE: An input port may have only one handler word.
